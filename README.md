# flipside-crypto-illini-blockchain

This repo consists of work that I did for a project as part of my student club, Illini Blockchain. The following code, when put into the Flipside Crypto platform, creates a graph for each Layer 2 protocol to show how its gas fees have changed over time. This is to be used in comparison to the baseline Layer 2 Protocol we were analyzing, Base. There is also code that creates a table of the average transaction speed for each Layer 2 protocol when put into Flipside Crypto. 

All code files above are created using SQL.
